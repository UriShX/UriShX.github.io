<p>My name is Uri Shani, and I am a maker, a tinkerer, and an engineer.</p>

<p>I can design and build most anything out of wood, program and build Arduino and Raspberry Pi devices, design all sorts of mechanical contraptions and devices, and design rubber and plastic parts for any manufacturing technology. In the past year or so I’ve taught myself to program web apps, at first in order to provide virtual UI to Arduino apps, then later it became a goal all in it’s own.</p>

<p>You can find out more about some of my past and current projects on my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>. You can also read about some of my adventures in making over the last few years on my blog postings, below.</p>

        </h3><h2 id="setting-up-an-openwrt-dev-environment-on-a-raspberry-pi-3-b">Setting Up an OpenWRT Dev Environment on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+</h2>

<p>It’s been a while since I last tinkered with something fun, but I finally got around to setting up an OpenWRT development environment on my Raspberry Pi 3 B+. This time, it’s for version 2 of my VPN profile switcher script, which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/urishx/vpn-profile-switcher">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: this post is about setting up a shell script dev environment on OpenWRT, not an actual OpenWRT development environment. For that, please follow the official <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/start">developer’s guide</a></strong></p>

<h3 id="flashing-openwrt">Flashing OpenWRT</h3>

<p>To start, I obtained the most recent <a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi">OpenWRT image for the Raspberry Pi</a> and flashed it onto an SD card. The process was simple - download the image, use Balena Etcher, and you’re ready to proceed. Afterward, I powered on the Pi, set a password, and added my SSH keys from my main machine. It’s important to prioritize security and accessibility, isn’t it?</p>

<p>To make sure I had enough space for everything, I followed OpenWRT’s guide to <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/installation/installation_methods/sd_card#expanding_the_filesystem">expand the filesystem</a> for ext4. This step is crucial, especially if you plan on installing packages or running scripts.</p>

<h3 id="wifi-hotspot-and-wan-setup">WiFi Hotspot and WAN Setup</h3>

<p>Next, I turned the Pi into a WiFi hotspot and set the ethernet port as WAN. This means the Pi can share its internet connection wirelessly while staying wired to my main router.</p>

<h3 id="adding-a-wifi-wwan">Adding a WiFi WWAN</h3>

<p>Now, for a bit of fun – I had a spare TL-822N USB WiFi adapter and decided to add a WiFi WWAN. I followed a <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/t/configuring-tl-wn822n-usb-wifi-adapter/60889/6">guide on the OpenWRT forum</a>, but ran into some issues with the adapter repeatedly failing to connect. After some head-scratching, I figured it might be a power issue. Swapped out the power supply for a beefier 3W one - and the problem was solved.</p>

<h3 id="why-the-wwan">Why the WWAN?</h3>

<p>You might wonder why go through the hassle of adding a WWAN. Well, I wanted to keep the ethernet port on my main router free and have a ready-to-use travel router for future adventures.</p>

<h3 id="getting-openvpn-running">Getting OpenVPN Running</h3>

<p>With the networking sorted, it was time to get OpenVPN up and running with NordVPN. I followed my own instructions from the <a href="https://github.com/urishx/vpn-profile-switcher#readme">repo’s README</a> – always nice when past me makes things easier for future me.</p>

<h3 id="ssh-convenience">SSH Convenience</h3>

<p>To make my life easier, I ensured my SSH connection was rock-solid and installed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> on the Pi. On my main machine, I set up the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Kelvin.vscode-sshfs">SSH FS</a> extension in VS Code and installed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssh-sftp-server</code> package on the Pi, following OpenWRT’s documentation. This setup lets me edit files on the Pi directly from VS Code, which provides some useful quality of life features, such as switching between files easily, syntax highlighting, and Copilot.</p>

<h3 id="final-touches">Final Touches</h3>

<p>Lastly, I installed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git-http</code> packages on the Pi so I could clone and manage repos directly. With everything in place, my OpenWRT dev environment was ready to roll.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>So there you have it – a solid OpenWRT development environment on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. Perfect for freeing up your main router’s ethernet connection or having a travel-ready router. Happy tinkering!</p>

<p>Cheers,
Uri</p>

        </h3><p>In my <a href="/2020/12/16/Customizing-Jekyll's-default-theme.html">last post</a> 
I detailed how I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and the the new version (3) of the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima</a> theme, to style my site so that it looked similar to the WordPress team’s <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentythirteen/">Twentythirteen theme</a>. <br />
In this post, I am going to outline how I created a new layout portfolio that could showcase any project of my making/tinkering/engineering/enginerding - be it a woodworking project, a mechanical contraption, or a Python script.</p>

        </h3><p>Jekyll installs with a nice, clean theme, called <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima</a>. While there are <em>a lot</em> of nice themes out there, I had both a clear view in my head of what I wanted to accomplish, and ample time thanks to CoVid19. So, armed with <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima’s</a> source and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/">Jekyll’s documentation</a>, I decided to have a go with modifying the theme a bit, and in this post I’ll try to outline the way I went about it.</p>

        </h3><p>I decided to separate this blog from my main website. The main reason being that I need to use the website as an online portfolio, and I did not think there’s a justification to mix in the blog and too much personal stuff in that. The other reason is that I feel more comfortable writing about technical stuff in English, and my portfolio and business pages need to be in both Hebrew and English. <br />
Hope it works well, though if it doesn’t I can still probably figure out how to revert the process.</p>

I hope my wife, which designed the lampshade, will someday do a write-up concerning her design decisions.</p>

  <li>I have this vision of building an easy to assemble and program DIY MIDI controller. This is supposed to be a modular system for musicians, DJ’s, sound technicians, etc., who don’t want to learn electronics or (even basic) programming.</li>

My mother who is a librarian took me with her to a warehouse of a company that imported magazines from around the world to Israel. She took me there to look at comics, but I found there fascinating magazines on all kinds of subjects. There were firearms magazines, sewing magazines, magazines for car and motorcycle enthusiasts, and many other topics. The best magazines I found (and my mother bought me) were the fringe and wacky comics and musical instruments magazines.</p>
