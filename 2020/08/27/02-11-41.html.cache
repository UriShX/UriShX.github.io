    <p>I’ve got a Delta style 3d printer that’s causing me frustration. I bought this printer a few years ago, when cheap clones from China were still few, and were still not very cheap. I can’t really remember prices at the time, but I was fresh out of college and not very familiar with the hardware and software required to run RepRap machines, so I couldn’t really asses the quality of the kit from the parts listed. I’d like to say I’m older and wiser now, but to be honest, at most I can say that I know a bit more now about what I don’t know. 
<!--more-->
Anyway, the printer seemed like a good candidate for an idea I had, which required a circular base. This idea of mine never took shape, but I have already bought the machine, paid an arm and a leg for shipping and customs, and it was certainly a challenge to get it assembled and working - so I stuck with it, learning bit by bit how to dial it in and finally get semi-reasonable prints out of it.
So I found the cheapest Delta printer that seemed like a complete kit, an He3d k200. It was about 200 USD, If I recall correctly, and it checked all the boxes - it was listed as a Delta (which I knew had a circular printing platform), had a 200 mm diameter by 300 mm build volume, and listed an e3d v6 hotend and the ability to add a heated bed as an extra. Most importantly, in the pictures of the listing it looked like all the parts were marked, well packaged, and labeled, so going on that I assumed it would be an easy build. It definitely wasn’t. Not that it was that hard to figure out, but there were more than a few things going wrong, right from the beginning.
There were four major things that made building the kit a challenge. Firstly, the box in which the printer came in contained a packing list, but did not contain a bill of materials (BOM), neither were the contents of each individual bag or box listed anywhere. Second, which is somewhat connected to the first issue, is that there were no written or illustrated instructions anywhere. If there had been, then perhaps a BOM wasn’t needed, but having to go only on a series of not very good, concise, or even ordered YouTube videos made the job of matching the correct screws each time a pain. Third issue were bent, headless, stripped and otherwise misshapen screws. There were only a few of those, but some of those were essential for getting a certain stage done, and without finishing that certain stage no further work could be done. So I had to stop each time, go and look for the correct screw at a specialized shop since these were not stocked by any of the local hardware stores, than go on and finish the stage - only to find I now had another screw I had to replace. That would have been much easier to spot had there been a full BOM or a more detailed packing list. It was even more frustrating to find out after the build was done that the manufacturer packed a few extra T-nuts and matching bolts, which I suppose were meant to allow for further customization, but all of the bolts for completing the build were counted and no pack contained an extra bolt. Actually, there was one bolt missing. The fourth and last gripe I had when building the machine was actually a specific part, and its quality. In a Delta robot, the part holding the toolhead is called an effector. That part is not only essential to the function of the machine, it is also essential to the alignment of the toolhead relative to the work platform. The effector in the kit I received was 3d printed. Now, with that in itself I do not have any problem. But the part I received was of such low quality, that it begs the question - are the people behind this machine actually know how to operate a 3d printer, and If so what are the capabilities of the machine I just bought? As a functional part, I can’t really complain about the rough printing quality of it, though I think it indicates that the manufacturer doesn’t really care too much about his brand. But what was wrong with the part were it’s dimensions. The part was shrunk by about 10%, which meant that not only screw holes had to be bored out to accept the bolts, but that one of the key components in the machine’s ability to perform it’s job of printing relatively parallel to the bed could not be achieved. This was a major source for my frustration of my frustration with this printer for quite some time, and it wasn’t until I researched it further that I found out why I could not get either good first layer adhesion, nor was I able to get accurate engineered parts out of it.
So, in this blog post and in the following posts, I will describe what I had to do to get it working in a reasonable manner, lay out a plan for further improvements, and hopefully get better, more accurate, prints out of this kit. I hope that with this series of posts I will be able to help others who bought this printer or it’s bigger sibling, the k280, to achieve a better experience out of assembling this printer.
I have to stress that this is not a review of the printer, and that I will send a link to this post to the manufacturer. I will post here any responses I will get from them. I also need to add a disclaimer - I’ve searched online for reviews of both this printer as well as the k280, and of the little I have found, there seems to be quite a bit of improvement on the instructions, which now seems to be sent printed in an illustrated color booklet, at least with the k280. Another point is that the manufacturer has a Skype account, and have set up a Facebook group for owners of their printers, and the links to both of these were provided with the kit, and are also displayed on their website. I did not get in touch with the manufacturer, and I did not have a Facebook account at the time, so I suppose that my experience could have been made easier had I used those when I was building the kit.
So, the first order of business was to assemble the printer. As I wrote above, it wasn’t smooth sailing, mainly due to the combination of no written instructions, and missing or misshapen screws. Because no BOM was included, I had to figure out which bolt went where based on the order of operations layed out in the manufacturer’s YouTube videos, and when I got stuck the process had to be postponed until I got the right bolt, unless there was something else I could work on in the meantime. When it came to assemble the effector assembly, other problems cropped up because of its deformation, which was most probably caused by shrinking (I assume it was printed in ABS, which shrinks a lot after cooling). I drilled out the shrunk down holes for the bolts that link the arms to the effector, as well as the holes for attaching the hotend. When I got the right size bolts, it was time for wiring, which was helped by a basic drawing. As far as my memory of the experience goes, the only question that arose during this was how to match the towers of the delta printer in relation to the x, y, and z markings on the PCB, which I most likely just found by searching Google. Next came the firmware, and setting up Repetier Host on my PC, as was outlined in the YouTube videos. At first I did not connect the heated bed, as I was eager to finally get the machine printing,</p>
