								I decided to separate this blog from my main website. The main
								reason being that I need to use the website as an online
								portfolio, and I did not think there’s a justification to mix in
								the blog and too much personal stuff in that. The other reason
								is that I feel more comfortable writing about technical stuff in
								English, and my portfolio and business pages need to be in both
								Hebrew and English. <br />
								Hope it works well, though if it doesn’t I can still probably
								figure out how to revert the process.

								This post is mostly a technical documentation of a project I
								have done a few years ago, and have never been documented
								before. The reason for doing a write-up now is so I can have a
								step back and see where I am today, compared to a few years ago.
								Also, it might be interesting to others. I hope my wife, which
								designed the lampshade, will someday do a write-up concerning
								her design decisions.

								I kind of let the blog thing fade. I’m not a fan of documenting,
								I’m always thinking that what I think today might sound awful
								tomorrow, and that who the hell am I to actually come up with
								ideas, and similar debilitating thoughts. So I usually just
								don’t document. But… I set up this blog in the hope of actually
								writing down some of my thoughts, and I haven’t really used it
								yet, so… Here goes:

									I have this vision of building an easy to assemble and program
									DIY MIDI controller. This is supposed to be a modular system
									for musicians, DJ’s, sound technicians, etc., who don’t want
									to learn electronics or (even basic) programming.

								When I was about 13 I became fascinated with the design of
								electric guitars. My mother who is a librarian took me with her
								to a warehouse of a company that imported magazines from around
								the world to Israel. She took me there to look at comics, but I
								found there fascinating magazines on all kinds of subjects.
								There were firearms magazines, sewing magazines, magazines for
								car and motorcycle enthusiasts, and many other topics. The best
								magazines I found (and my mother bought me) were the fringe and
								wacky comics and musical instruments magazines.
